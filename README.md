When i'm not on my computer, you can probably find me at the tennis court. I also love traveling to new places and capturing their beauty through film photography so make sure to checkout my [photography account](https://www.instagram.com/analog.collection/)! Now before I end, i'd just like to share my favorite quote.

> We have two lives, and the second begins when we realize we only have one.

That's all! Have a great day and happy living. 💌
