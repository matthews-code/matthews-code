When i'm not on my computer, you can probably find me at the tennis court. I also love exploring new places and eating delicious food so make sure to checkout my [foodie account](https://www.instagram.com/munch.buuunch/)! Now before I end, i'd just like to share my favourite quote.

> We have two lives, and the second begins when we realize we only have one.

That's all! Have a great day and happy coding. 💌
