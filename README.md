## Greetings! ðŸ‘‹

I am a developer who drinks too much tea while coding and is passionate about turning ideas into a reality. Welcome to my profile!

### ðŸš€ About Me
- I am currently taking the [Scrimba](https://v2.scrimba.com/) bootcamp course.
- My favorite programming language is Python or Javascript (yes, Typescript too)!
- My new portfolio is currently being developed! In the meantime, you can check out my old [portfolio website](https://www.mattbuen.dev/).
- I've recently started a **Youtube channel!** Check out my [latest video](https://youtu.be/yOTpvIFy2Gk). ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘€

When i'm not on my computer, you can probably find me at the tennis court. I also love traveling to new destinations and capturing their beauty through film photography so make sure to checkout my [photography account](https://www.instagram.com/analog.collection/)! Oh and of course I love eating good food! Now before I end, i'd just like to share my favorite quote.

> We have two lives, and the second begins when we realize we only have one.

That's all! Have a great day and happy living. ðŸ’Œ
